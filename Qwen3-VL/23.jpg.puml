Here's the PlantUML code for the given UML class diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Person {
    - name : String
    - age : double
}

Person "1" -- "*" Person : parents
Person "1" -- "*" Person : children

@enduml
```

This code represents the `Person` class with attributes `name` and `age`, along with self-associations representing `parents` and `children`.
