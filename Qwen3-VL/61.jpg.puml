Here's the PlantUML code that represents the class diagram from the image:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Cattery {
    - name: String
    - address: String
}

class Cat {
    - breed: String
    - age: double
    - id: String
}

class Person {
    - name: String
}

Cattery "0..1" -- "*" Cat : resides
Cattery "1" -- "*" Person : manages
Person "1" -- "*" Cat : owner

@enduml
```

You can visualize this by pasting the code into a PlantUML renderer.
