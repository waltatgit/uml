Here's the PlantUML code that represents the UML class diagram from the image:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Student

class MScStudent extends Student
class BScStudent extends Student

MScStudent --|> Student
BScStudent --|> Student

@enduml
```

This code represents the generalization relationship between the `Student` class and its subclasses `MScStudent` and `BScStudent`.
