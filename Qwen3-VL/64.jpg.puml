Here is the PlantUML code based on the provided UML class diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Journey {
    +id: String
}

class Route {
    +id: String
}

class Place {
    +id: String
    +name: String
    +x: double
    +y: double
}

class TransportMode {
    +name: String
    +emissions: double
}

Journey "1" --> "*" Route : possibleRoutes
Route "*" --> "1" Place : from
Route "*" --> "1" Place : to
Route "*" --> "*" TransportMode

@enduml
```

This code faithfully represents the classes, attributes, and relationships (with multiplicities) depicted in the hand-drawn UML diagram.
