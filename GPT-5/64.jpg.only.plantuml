' Assumptions based on the sketch:
' - Journey has many possibleRoutes to Route: Journey "1" -- "*" Route.
' - Route is related to Place in three ways:
'   * locations: many-to-many between Route and Place.
'   * from: many Routes can start from one Place (Route "*" -- "1" Place).
'   * to: many Routes can end at one Place (Route "*" -- "1" Place).
' - Route is associated with Transport Mode in a many-to-many relationship; label not shown.
' TODO: If any additional labels or directions were intended on the Route–Transport Mode link, please clarify.
