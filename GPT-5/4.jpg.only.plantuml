' Assumptions:
' - The link between Order and Payment is a simple undirected association with multiplicities 1 (Order) and * (Payment); no diamond shown, so not aggregation/composition.
' - Attribute types and visibilities are not indicated in the drawing; names are preserved as-is.
' - Payment may be a generalization parent (superclass); no indication of abstract formatting, so it is kept as a regular class.
