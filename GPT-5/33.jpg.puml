Sure, here's the PlantUML code based on the provided UML diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Student {
  id : String
  name : String
  year : int
}

class Course {
  code : String
  credits : int
}

Student "1" -- "*" Course : attends

class BScStudent extends Student
class MScStudent extends Student

@enduml
```

This code defines the `Student` and `Course` classes, including their attributes, and establishes a relationship between them. It also includes inheritance for `BScStudent` and `MScStudent`.
