' Assumptions:
' - Asterisks near association ends indicate multiplicity *.
' - "0..1" shown next to Tenant and Maintenance Agency indicate those end multiplicities.
' - Relationship labels visible: "lease" (Tenant—House) and "maintain" (Maintenance Agency—House). The "maintain" label was hard to read; interpreted as maintain.
' - Class names with spaces are quoted to preserve exact names.
' - No attributes or operations were specified in the diagram.
