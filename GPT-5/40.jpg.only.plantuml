' Assumptions based on the hand-drawn diagram:
' - Relationships appear undirected unless an inheritance arrowhead is drawn.
' - Multiplicity "*" is clearly shown on both ends between Account and Transactions (many-to-many).
' - A short link exists between "Current Account" and "Savings Account" with a "1" near the Savings side; the other end is unclear, assumed "*" (many-to-one). TODO: verify this association and multiplicities.
' - Attribute names are taken verbatim; unclear spellings (e.g., "card number"/"cord number", "account n") are preserved. TODO: confirm exact spellings and intended types.
