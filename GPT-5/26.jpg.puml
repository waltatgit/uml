Here's the PlantUML notation for the diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

class State {
    +name: String
}

class Transition {
    +trigger: String
}

State "1" --> "*" Transition : source
State "1" --> "*" Transition : target
State "1" --> "*" Transition : outgoing

@enduml
```

This diagram features a `State` class with an association to the `Transition` class. Each association is labeled to reflect its purpose in the system.
