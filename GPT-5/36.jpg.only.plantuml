' TODO: Multiplicities and directions are unclear on several associations due to the hand-drawn nature.
' TODO: Assumptions made:
'   - Manager manages many Guest(s): Manager "1" -- "*" Guest.
'   - Manager is associated to Inventory (quantity not specified).
'   - Guest is assigned to a Room (assumed 1-to-1 for simplicity).
'   - Receptionist handles many Bill(s): Receptionist "1" -- "0..*" Bill.
'   - Receptionist serves many Guest(s) (assumed): Receptionist "1" -- "*" Guest.
'   - Chef prepares many Food items and each Food can be prepared by many Chefs: many-to-many.
'   - Food associated with Housekeeping (purpose/multiplicity not specified).
