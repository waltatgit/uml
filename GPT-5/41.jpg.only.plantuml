' TODO: Multiplicity "n" is interpreted as "*" on both ends of relationships.
' TODO: The diagram shows two "Compilation" and two "Sweeping" boxes (left/right) with identical names; assuming a single class for each that specializes both Paperback and Hardcover (multiple inheritance), since no packages are indicated.
' TODO: Right-side "Compilation.id:number" conflicts with left-side "id:int"; using int for consistency.
