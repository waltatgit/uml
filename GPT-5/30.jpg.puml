Here's the PlantUML representation of the provided UML class diagram:

```plantuml
@startuml

class Order {
    orderNumber: String
    total: double
}

class OrderItem {
    item: String
    quantity: int
    price: double
}

Order "1" -- "0..*" OrderItem: items

@enduml
```

This code mirrors the diagram's structure, including class attributes and the relationship between `Order` and `OrderItem`.
