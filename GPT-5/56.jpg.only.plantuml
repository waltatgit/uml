' Assumptions:
' - Types are not shown in the diagram; attributes are left untyped.
' - Order–OrderLine multiplicities are slightly unclear; assumed a single Order has many OrderLines (1 to *) and each OrderLine belongs to exactly one Order.
' - The Corporate Customer–Employee association shows "*" near Corporate Customer and "0..1" near Employee; modeled as many Corporate Customers may be assigned to zero or one Employee.
' - No operations or stereotypes were indicated.
